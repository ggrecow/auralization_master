        % Synthesis of buzzsaw tones. Procedure based on the work of:

        % Rizzi, Aumann, Lopes and Burley Auralization of Hybrid Wingâ€“Body Aircraft Flyover
        % Noise from System Noise Predictions, JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT Vol. 51, No. 6,

        %   1) fundamental freq and its <nHarmonics> are calculated based
        %       on the settings of the engine (i.e. N1 and number of
        %       blades). Because this auralization framework works with
        %       doppler-shifted EMISSION values, the doppler-effect is
        %       considered in this process.
        %
        %   2) The buzzsaw emission spectra provided by PANAM is used to obtain the SPL of 
        %        the tones calculated in step 1. The steps used for that are:
        %
        %       2.1) The 1/3-OB in which the freq of the tones calculated in step 1 lays inside 
        %               is obtained 
        %
        %       2.2) The 1/3-OB in which the freq of the emission spectra provided by PANAM    
        %               lays inside is obtained   
        %
        %       2.3) The SPL predicted within a 1/3-OB of Step 2.2 is
        %              distributed to the same the tones calculated in Step
        %              2.1. If more then one tone calculated within Step 1
        %              lays within the same 1/3-OB, the amplitude predicted
        %              by PANAM for that 1/3-OB is distributed equally to all tones
